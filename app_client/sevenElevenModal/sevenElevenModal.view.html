            <p>• Developed an Android Application where there are several products in the app</p>
            <p>• I created a home screen giving a few details about the company and containing a link to a Product activity</p>
            <p>• I created a Product activity that displays every product with each one being clickable</p>
            <p>• I created a Display activity that will display details about the product depending on what item was clicked, for example it would display coffee details if the coffee item was clicked</p>
            <p>• I created a Checkout activity that lets users input the name of the person making the order, how many they want and how they will pay (e.g radio button with Visa, Debit, Cash)</p>
            <p>• Users can select the product they need and can order the products</p>
            <p>• The selected items will be added to the cart. I used JSON Serializer to save the orders and also I used listView to display the products</p>
